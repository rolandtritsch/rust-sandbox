# My Rust Sandbox - playing with Rust and Cargo and Crate

To make this work ...

* ... you need to install rust (e.g. `brew install rust`) and cargo (e.g. `brew install cargo`) and git (e.g. `brew install git`)
* ... and you need to clone this repo (e.g. `git clone https://github.com/rolandtritsch/rust-sandbox`)
* ... and then you can start to run some of the examples by changing into the respective sub directories and run `cargo run`
